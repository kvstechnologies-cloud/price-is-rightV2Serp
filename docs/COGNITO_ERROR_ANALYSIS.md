# AWS Cognito Error Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the AWS Cognito authentication errors you're experiencing and provides solutions for each issue.

## Errors Encountered

### 1. **404 Error for `cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`**

**What it means:**
- The AWS Cognito service endpoint is not responding correctly
- This could indicate network connectivity issues or AWS service problems

**Possible causes:**
- Network connectivity problems
- AWS region configuration issues
- The Cognito user pool might not exist
- Firewall or proxy blocking the request

**Solutions:**
1. **Check network connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
   ```

2. **Verify AWS region:**
   - Ensure you're using the correct region (us-east-1)
   - Check if your Cognito resources are in the right region

3. **Check AWS service status:**
   - Visit https://status.aws.amazon.com/
   - Look for any Cognito service issues

### 2. **400 Error for `cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`**

**What it means:**
- "Bad Request" - the request is malformed or contains invalid parameters
- The server received the request but couldn't process it

**Possible causes:**
- Invalid credentials being sent
- Incorrect user pool client ID
- Unsupported authentication flow type
- Missing required parameters
- Invalid user pool ID

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify configuration:**
   ```javascript
   // Check your amplify-config.js
   {
     Auth: {
       region: 'us-east-1',
       userPoolId: 'us-east-1_90Axc1DKW',        // Verify this exists
       userPoolWebClientId: '6uvpr126ag8efbaqf47fd17bnh', // Verify this exists
       identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:df36e426-3c7d-474a-af65-89e882fe22ec'
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check user pool existence:**
   - Log into AWS Console
   - Go to Cognito > User Pools
   - Verify the user pool `us-east-1_90Axc1DKW` exists

3. **Verify client configuration:**
   - Check that the client ID `6uvpr126ag8efbaqf47fd17bnh` exists
   - Ensure it's configured for web applications

### 3. **`UserNotFoundException: User does not exist`**

**What it means:**
- The user you're trying to log in with doesn't exist in the Cognito user pool
- This is the most specific and actionable error

**Possible causes:**
- User was never created in the user pool
- User was deleted from the user pool
- Wrong email/username being used
- User pool ID is incorrect
- User exists in a different user pool

**Solutions:**

#### **Immediate Fix - Create a Test User:**

1. **Using AWS Console:**
   - Go to AWS Console > Cognito > User Pools
   - Select your user pool
   - Go to "Users and groups" tab
   - Click "Create user"
   - Enter email: `test@example.com`
   - Enter password: `Password123!`
   - Mark as "Confirmed"

2. **Using AWS CLI:**
   ```bash
   aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
     --user-pool-id us-east-1_90Axc1DKW \
     --username test@example.com \
     --user-attributes Name=email,Value=test@example.com \
     --temporary-password Password123! \
     --message-action SUPPRESS
   ```

3. **Using Amplify in your app:**
   ```javascript
   // Add this to your diagnostic tool
   await window.aws_amplify.Auth.signUp({
     username: 'test@example.com',
     password: 'Password123!',
     attributes: {
       email: 'test@example.com'
     }
   });
   ```

#### **Verify User Pool Configuration:**

1. **Check user pool settings:**
   - Username attributes: Should include "email"
   - Required attributes: Should include "email"
   - Password policy: Ensure it matches your test password

2. **Check client app settings:**
   - Allowed OAuth flows
   - Callback URLs
   - Identity providers

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Use the Diagnostic Tool
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test/cognito-diagnostic`

This tool will:
- Check Amplify configuration
- Test network connectivity
- Verify user pool access
- Test user creation and login
- Provide detailed error analysis

### Step 2: Check AWS Console
1. Go to AWS Console > Cognito > User Pools
2. Verify the user pool `us-east-1_90Axc1DKW` exists
3. Check the user pool client `6uvpr126ag8efbaqf47fd17bnh`
4. Look for any users in the pool

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
Check your `src/config/amplify-config.js`:
```javascript
export const amplifyConfig = {
    Auth: {
        region: 'us-east-1',
        userPoolId: 'us-east-1_90Axc1DKW',        // Verify this
        userPoolWebClientId: '6uvpr126ag8efbaqf47fd17bnh', // Verify this
        identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:df36e426-3c7d-474a-af65-89e882fe22ec'
    }
};
```

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Create Test Users
If the user pool exists but has no users:
1. Create a test user in AWS Console
2. Use the diagnostic tool to test login
3. Verify the user can authenticate

### Solution 2: Fix Configuration
If the user pool doesn't exist:
1. Create a new user pool in AWS Console
2. Update the configuration in `amplify-config.js`
3. Create a user pool client
4. Update the client ID in configuration

### Solution 3: Network Issues
If there are connectivity problems:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify no firewall is blocking AWS requests
3. Try from a different network
4. Check AWS service status

## Testing the Fix

After implementing any solution:

1. **Restart your application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Use the diagnostic tool:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5000/test/cognito-diagnostic`
   - Run all tests
   - Check for any remaining errors

3. **Test in your main application:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Try logging in with the test user
   - Check browser console for errors

## Prevention

To prevent these issues in the future:

1. **Always create test users** when setting up Cognito
2. **Use the diagnostic tool** regularly to check configuration
3. **Keep configuration in version control** but never commit real credentials
4. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
5. **Test authentication flow** before deploying to production

## Next Steps

1. Run the diagnostic tool: `http://localhost:5000/test/cognito-diagnostic`
2. Create a test user in AWS Console
3. Test the login flow
4. Report back with the results from the diagnostic tool

This will help us identify the exact issue and provide a targeted solution.
