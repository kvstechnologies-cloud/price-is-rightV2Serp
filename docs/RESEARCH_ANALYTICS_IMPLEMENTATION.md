## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. ResearchTracker Service (`server/services/ResearchTracker.js`)
- **In-memory Storage**: Uses Map and arrays for fast access (easily migratable to database)
- **Session Management**: Tracks user sessions with start/end times and metrics
- **Attempt Tracking**: Monitors individual research attempts from start to completion
- **Analytics Engine**: Calculates success rates, performance metrics, and insights

#### 2. Enhanced InsuranceItemPricer (`server/models/InsuranceItemPricer.js`)
- **Integrated Tracking**: Automatically tracks all pricing attempts
- **Research Session Support**: Manages research sessions and user context
- **Analytics Methods**: Provides access to research analytics and insights

#### 3. API Endpoints (`server/index.js`)
- **Session Management**: Start/end research sessions
- **Analytics Access**: Get real-time analytics and historical data
- **Data Export**: Export research data for external analysis
- **Data Management**: Clear data for testing and reset

### Data Flow

```
User Request ‚Üí ResearchTracker.trackResearchAttempt() ‚Üí 
InsuranceItemPricer.findBestPrice() ‚Üí 
ResearchTracker.updateSearchResults() ‚Üí 
ResearchTracker.completeResearchAttempt() ‚Üí 
Analytics Available via API
```

## üìä API Endpoints

### Session Management
- `POST /api/research/session/start` - Start a new research session
- `POST /api/research/session/end` - End current research session

### Analytics & Insights
- `GET /api/research/analytics` - Get comprehensive research analytics
- `GET /api/research/history` - Get research history with filters
- `GET /api/research/sessions` - Get session analytics
- `GET /api/research/insights` - Get performance insights and recommendations

### Data Management
- `GET /api/research/export` - Export all research data (JSON)
- `POST /api/research/clear` - Clear all research data (for testing)

## üîß Usage Examples

### Starting a Research Session
```javascript
// Start a new session
const response = await fetch('/api/research/session/start', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    sessionId: 'user_session_123', 
    userId: 'john_doe' 
  })
});

const session = await response.json();
console.log('Session started:', session.session.sessionId);
```

### Getting Research Analytics
```javascript
// Get real-time analytics
const response = await fetch('/api/research/analytics');
const analytics = await response.json();

console.log('Success Rate:', analytics.analytics.overallSuccessRate + '%');
console.log('Total Attempts:', analytics.analytics.totalResearchAttempts);
console.log('AI Research Success Rate:', analytics.analytics.aiResearchSuccessRate + '%');
```

### Filtering Research History
```javascript
// Get successful searches only
const response = await fetch('/api/research/history?success=true&limit=50');
const history = await response.json();

console.log('Successful searches:', history.history.length);
```

## üìà Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive test dashboard is available at `test/research-analytics-test.html` that demonstrates:

- **Session Management**: Start/end sessions and view session status
- **Product Search Testing**: Test various product searches to generate data
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live dashboard with success rates and performance indicators
- **Historical Analysis**: Filter and view research history
- **Performance Insights**: AI-generated recommendations for improvement
- **Data Export**: Download research data for external analysis

## üéØ Key Metrics Tracked

### Success Metrics
- **Overall Success Rate**: Percentage of successful product pricing attempts
- **AI Research Success Rate**: Effectiveness of AI research when direct search fails
- **Search Strategy Effectiveness**: Which alternative search strategies work best

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Response Time**: Mean time to complete a research attempt
- **Processing Duration**: Time spent in each research phase
- **Session Performance**: Success rates and efficiency per user session

### Volume Metrics
- **Total Research Attempts**: Overall system usage
- **AI Research Triggered**: How often AI research is needed
- **Session Count**: Number of user sessions processed

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Database Integration
The current implementation uses in-memory storage but is designed for easy migration to:

- **PostgreSQL**: For structured data and complex queries
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document storage
- **Redis**: For high-performance caching and real-time metrics

### Advanced Analytics
- **Machine Learning Insights**: Predictive analytics for success rates
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Pattern recognition in search behavior
- **Performance Optimization**: Automated recommendations for system tuning

### Real-time Monitoring
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live updates of research progress
- **Alert System**: Notifications for performance degradation
- **Dashboard Integration**: Embed analytics in main application

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open `test/research-analytics-test.html` in a browser
3. Start a research session
4. Perform test product searches
5. View analytics and insights
6. Export data for verification

### API Testing
```bash
# Start a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/research/session/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "test_123", "userId": "tester"}'

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/research/analytics

# Get history
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/research/history?success=true&limit=10"
```
