# Database and S3 Integration Fix for AWS Environment

## Issues Identified

1. **API URL Double /api Path** - ✅ FIXED
2. **Database Integration** - Audit system not persisting data
3. **S3 Upload Integration** - Files not being uploaded to S3
4. **Environment Variable Configuration** - Need to verify all required vars are set

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. API URL Issue (FIXED)
The double `/api` path issue has been resolved in `client/src/services/ApiService.js` with the URL construction fix.

### 2. Database Integration Issue
The audit system is properly implemented but may have connection issues:
- Environment variables are configured in `apprunner.yaml`
- Database connection is being attempted in `src/audit/index.js`
- The enhanced processing route has audit integration code

### 3. S3 Upload Issue
S3 upload is implemented in the enhanced processing route but may fail silently:
- S3 configuration is present in `apprunner.yaml`
- Upload code exists in `server/routes/enhancedProcessingRoutes.js`
- Error handling may be masking failures

## Environment Variables Verification

Based on `apprunner.yaml`, these variables should be available:

### Database Configuration
```
DB_HOST=price-is-right.cluster-c4568s4csoxh.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=1234Inf56
DB_NAME=price_is_right_admin
DB_POOL_MIN=0
DB_POOL_MAX=3
```

### S3 Configuration
```
S3_BUCKET=pricinginsurance-audit-dev-2025
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_PREFIX_EXCEL=excel/
S3_PREFIX_IMAGES=images/
S3_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true
```

### Audit Configuration
```
AUDIT_ENABLED=true
```

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables
Add this debug endpoint to verify environment variables are loaded:

```javascript
// Add to server/index.js
app.get('/api/debug/env', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    audit: {
      enabled: process.env.AUDIT_ENABLED,
      dbHost: process.env.DB_HOST ? 'SET' : 'MISSING',
      dbName: process.env.DB_NAME ? 'SET' : 'MISSING',
      s3Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET ? 'SET' : 'MISSING',
      s3Region: process.env.S3_REGION ? 'SET' : 'MISSING'
    },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### 2. Test Database Connection
The audit system already has debug endpoints:
- `GET /api/logs/debug/counts` - Check table row counts
- `GET /api/logs/debug/raw-jobs` - Check recent jobs
- `POST /api/logs/debug/s3-test` - Test S3 upload

### 3. Enhanced Logging
The enhanced processing route should log:
- S3 upload attempts and results
- Database insertion attempts and results
- Audit system initialization status

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### 1. File Processing Flow
1. User uploads CSV/Excel file
2. Frontend sends to `/api/enhanced/process-enhanced`
3. Backend processes file and generates results
4. **S3 Upload**: Original file uploaded to S3 bucket
5. **Database Insert**: Job, items, and results saved to database
6. Response sent to frontend with results

### 2. Database Tables Populated
- `users` - User records
- `files` - Uploaded file metadata with S3 references
- `jobs` - Processing job records
- `job_items` - Individual items processed
- `search_events` - Search API calls made
- `final_choices` - Final pricing decisions

### 3. S3 Bucket Structure
```

```

## Verification Commands

### 1. Check Audit System Status
```bash
curl https://gtexrubbw6.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/logs/health
```

### 2. Check Database Counts
```bash
curl https://gtexrubbw6.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/logs/debug/counts
```

### 3. Test S3 Upload
```bash
curl -X POST https://gtexrubbw6.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/logs/debug/s3-test
```

### 4. Check Recent Jobs
```bash
curl https://gtexrubbw6.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/api/logs/debug/raw-jobs
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Database Connection Fails
1. Verify RDS instance is running and accessible
2. Check security groups allow connections from App Runner
3. Verify database credentials are correct
4. Check if database schema exists

### If S3 Upload Fails
1. Verify S3 bucket exists and is accessible
2. Check IAM permissions for App Runner service
3. Verify AWS region configuration
4. Check S3 bucket policies

### If Audit System Not Initializing
1. Check `AUDIT_ENABLED=true` is set
2. Verify all required environment variables are present
3. Check database connection can be established
4. Review audit system initialization logs

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the API URL fix** (already implemented)
2. **Test the audit endpoints** to verify database connectivity
3. **Process a test file** and check if data appears in database
4. **Verify S3 uploads** are working correctly
5. **Monitor logs** for any error messages

## Files Modified

- ✅ `client/src/services/ApiService.js` - Fixed double /api path issue
- 📋 `server/routes/enhancedProcessingRoutes.js` - Already has audit integration
- 📋 `src/audit/index.js` - Already has database integration
- 📋 `apprunner.yaml` - Already has environment variables

## Expected Result

After deployment, the application should:
1. ✅ Load without 404 errors (API URL fix)
2. 📊 Save processed files and results to database
3. ☁️ Upload files to S3 bucket
4. 📈 Populate audit dashboard with real data
5. 🔍 Allow viewing of processing history and statistics
